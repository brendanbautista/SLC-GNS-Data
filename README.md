# SLC-GNS-Data

#As discussed, can you please get me YTD data for all SLC to LAX ICT files per the below. I want to understand the % of TCS, AEX and OEX files moving on GNS each day. 

Let me know if you need additional information. I’m hoping to have this ahead of a conversation I’m having on Thursday. Let me know if you need more time.
