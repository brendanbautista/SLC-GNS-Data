# SLC-GNS-Data

As discussed, can you please get me YTD data for all SLC to LAX ICT files per the below. I want to understand the % of TCS, AEX and OEX files moving on GNS each day. 

Let me know if you need additional information. I’m hoping to have this ahead of a conversation I’m having on Thursday. Let me know if you need more time. 

11/11 Update:
Can you please pull YTD files for SLC only? Need to understand the following:

•	Transcon H files, first occurring FRD, BLP events.

•	AEX 4 files, first occurring DSN, FRD, SMP and BLP events.
