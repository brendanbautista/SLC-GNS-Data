# SLC-GNS-Data

YTD data for all SLC to LAX ICT files per the below. Want to understand the % of TCS, AEX and OEX files moving on GNS each day. 
- Exclude 'LAS' origin, only 'SLC'

11/11 Update:
Can you please pull YTD files for SLC only? Need to understand the following:

•	Transcon H files, first occurring FRD, BLP events.

•	AEX 4 files, first occurring DSN, FRD, SMP and BLP events.
